# Flower-Game

Made a kid friendly version of the game Hangman called Falling Petals. My aim was for the game to be created as an educational tool for teachers to use in a noncompetitive, classroom setting. In this iteration of the game players have more opportunity to correctly guess the word in comparison to a regular game of Hangman. I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS in this project.
